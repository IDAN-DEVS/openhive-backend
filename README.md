## Overview

Welcome to your project generated using StartEase! This guide will walk you through the basic configuration steps to get your backend project up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

Install project dependencies using npm :
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
OR

Install project dependencies using yarn :
```bash
yarn install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Your project relies on environment variables for configuration. To set up these variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   APP_NAME=YourAppName
   APP_PORT=3000
   APP_ENV=development
   ```
   Note: configuration variables should be added based on config in the environment.js file.


Replace `YourAppName`, `your-database-url`, `your-database-name`, etc., with your actual project and database information.

### Start the Project

Once you've configured your environment variables, you can start your project:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Your backend server should now be running at http://localhost:<specified-port>.
